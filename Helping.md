**android-vnc-viewer** is an open-source project, and its quality depends
on help from its community of users.

You can help by:

  * [Filing issue reports](http://code.google.com/p/android-vnc-viewer/issues/list)-- not just for bugs, but also to suggest enhancements.  Please look to see if an existing bug covers your problem or suggestion.

  * Providing patches-- Are you a developer who knows how to add a feature or fix a bug?  The source code for the currently available versions is in the antlersoft svn branch:  https://android-vnc-viewer.googlecode.com/svn/branches/antlersoft.  The source code is designed to build in the Eclipse ADT environment with the addition of the SQLiteGen plugin (which is also free and open source): http://code.google.com/p/sqlitegen  Send a patch (googlecode@antlersoft.com) or post it to the issue report.  If you will be contributing on an ongoing basis, we'll add you to the project.

  * Supporting other users-- Know a workaround for a reported issue?  Add it as a comment.  Check the [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/android-vnc-viewer).

  * Improving the documentation-- I know we need screen shots added to the documentation.  A wiz with wiki's?  Supply documentation patches.

  * Providing translations-- Want to make the app accessible to non-english speakers?  Provide translations of the wiki pages or the app resources.Android apps store their user-interface elements in XML files.
> Most user visible text is specified in the strings.xml file, so that's a good place to start.  The one you should be looking at is in Subversion at http://android-vnc-viewer.googlecode.com/svn/branches/antlersoft/androidVNC/res/values/strings.xml (You can browse the file here: http://code.google.com/p/android-vnc-viewer/source/browse/#svn/branches/antlersoft/androidVNC/res/values)

> Of course, not all the text that needs translation is in that file.  There's some English text embedded in the program source code.  The developers will have to take the lead on getting that out into the xml files where it can be properly translated.
